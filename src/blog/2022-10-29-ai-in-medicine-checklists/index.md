title: AI in Medicine Checklists
description: AI in Medicine Checklists. General information, reporting guidelines and checklists for AI-in-medicine researchers.

_This is an in progress post. More updates will be coming (soon)._

Artificial Intelligence / Machine learning application to other disciplines is an evolving area, including medicine. Many researchers are rushing to use machine learning without a comprehensive understanding. There are many pitfalls and errors in machine learning that even AI practitioners sometimes are not invulnerable. Many reporting guidelines and checklists were developed in an attempt to fix those problems, yet I expect many more to come as more issues appear. Some of them are for general AI research and some of them are specific to a particular field. In this blog post, I compile general information, reporting guidelines and checklists for AI-in-medicine researchers. They might not directly solve the problems, but they can help us keep the issues in concern and give more crucial information to readers. Besides researchers, healthcare stakeholders can use these resources to evaluate AI-in-medicine research. If you find any errors or missing resources, please kindly contact [me](https://twitter.com/ThewDhanat).
