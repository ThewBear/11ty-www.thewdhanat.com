title: Generative AI in scientific paper authoring
description: Essential ground rules for using generative AI tools like ChatGPT, large language model, or diffusion model responsibly while writing a scientific paper.
---

In this post, I have compiled a policy regarding how we can use generative AI when composing a scientific paper.

### Nature

[Tools such as ChatGPT threaten transparent science; here are our ground rules for their use](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00191-1)

[Brief guide for submission to Nature](https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/initial-submission)

[Authorship](https://www.nature.com/nature/editorial-policies/authorship)

> Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, do not currently satisfy our authorship criteria. Notably an attribution of authorship carries with it accountability for the work, which cannot be effectively applied to LLMs. Use of an LLM should be properly documented in the Methods section (and if a Methods section is not available, in a suitable alternative part) of the manuscript.

### Science

[ChatGPT is fun, but not an author](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg7879)

[Science Journals: Editorial Policies](https://www.science.org/content/page/science-journals-editorial-policies)

> Text generated from AI, machine learning, or similar algorithmic tools cannot be used in papers published in Science journals, nor can the accompanying figures, images, or graphics be the products of such tools, without explicit permission from the editors. In addition, an AI program cannot be an author of a Science journal paper.

### JAMA

[Instructions for Authors](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/pages/instructions-for-authors)

> The submission and publication of images created by artificial intelligence, machine learning tools, or similar technologies is discouraged, unless part of formal research design or methods, and is not permitted without clear description of the content that was created and the name of the model or tool, version and extension numbers, and manufacturer.

> The submission and publication of content created by artificial intelligence, language models, machine learning, or similar technologies is discouraged, unless part of formal research design or methods, and is not permitted without clear description of the content that was created and the name of the model or tool, version and extension numbers, and manufacturer.

> Nonhuman artificial intelligence, language models, machine learning, or similar technologies do not qualify for authorship. If these models or tools are used to create content or assist with writing or manuscript preparation, authors must take responsibility for the integrity of the content generated by these tools. Authors should report the use of artificial intelligence, language models, machine learning, or similar technologies to create content or assist with writing or editing of manuscripts in the Acknowledgment section or Methods section if this is part of formal research design or methods.

> Authors should report the use of artificial intelligence, language models, machine learning, or similar technologies to create content or assist with writing or editing of manuscripts in the Acknowledgment section or the Methods section if this is part of formal research design or methods. This should include a description of the content that was created or edited and the name of the language model or tool, version and extension numbers, and manufacturer. (Note: this does not include basic tools for checking grammar, spelling, references, etc.)

### PNAS

[Editorial and Journal Policies](https://www.pnas.org/author-center/editorial-and-journal-policies)

> Use of artificial intelligence (AI) software, such as ChatGPT, must be noted in the Materials and Methods (or Acknowledgments, if no Materials and Methods section is available) section of the manuscript and may not be listed as an author.
