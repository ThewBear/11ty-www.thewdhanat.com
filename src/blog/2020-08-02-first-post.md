Welcome to [my new blog](/blog) and this is the first post.

🎉🎉🎉

This blog lives on my website [thewdhanat.com](/), built with **11ty + tailwindcss**, and deployed to **Vercel** through **GitHub Actions**.

I build this blog as my [Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)🌱 and also as a space to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/)☀️.

The goal of my website is to try out modern web technology✨, optimize it to be as fast⚡️ as possible, and achieve 90+ scores on Lighthouse. Hence my current stack is 11ty with custom shortcodes to process css & js.

I also setup [Speedlify](https://speedlify.thewdhanat.com/), a tool to monitor website Lighthouse scores created by Zach Leatherman, to monitor some pages of my website every day. You can deploy your instance by following [this guide](https://www.zachleat.com/web/speedlify/).

You may notice that I use emoji a lot. They are [Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/) by Twitter loaded through CDN as an SVG. I use Twemoji for consistency across platforms and because it supports the latest Unicode emoji. So no more rectangle emoji, and looking nice. 🥰

Finally, you can have a look at the source code of this website on [GitHub](https://github.com/ThewBear/11ty-www.thewdhanat.com).
